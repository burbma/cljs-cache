# cljs.cache : Clojurescript port of clojure/core.cache

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.clojars.mmb90/cljs-cache.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.mmb90/cljs-cache)

* An underlying `CacheProtocol` used as the base abstraction for implementing new synchronous caches

* A `defcache` macro for hooking your `CacheProtocol` implementations into the Clojurescript associative data capabilities.

* Implementations of some basic caching strategies
  - Least-recently-used (LRUCache)
  - Time-to-live (TTLCache)
  - Naive cache (BasicCache)
  
* Factory functions for each existing cache type

## Example Usage

```clojure
    (require '[cljs.cache :as cache])
	
    (def C (cache/lru-cache-factory {:a 1, :b 2} :threshold 2))
	
    (if (cache/has? C :c)
      (cache/hit C :c)
      (cache/miss C :c 42))
	
    ;=> {:b 2, :c 42}
	
    (cache/evict C :b)
	
    ;=> {:a 1}
    
    (def C (cache/lru-cache-factory {:a 1, :b 2} :threshold 3))
	
    (if (cache/has? C :c)
      (cache/hit C :c)
      (cache/miss C :c 42))
	
	;=> {:a 1, :b 2, :c 42}
	
	;; Technically in order to see those results at the repl you'd have
	;; to use .-cache but I left it off for clarity since that's what's
	;; in the cache.
	
	(.-cache (cache/evict C :b))
	
	;=> {:a 1}
```
